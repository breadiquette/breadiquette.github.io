Good morning.

This past week, I received a kitchen scale as a gift. 

When I first learned to make sourdough, I relied on using one to ensure I was following recipes properly and using the exact right amount of every ingredient.

While I'm glad I had a kitchen scale at home, it became a crutch as I progressed in my sourdough baking abilities. I'd worry about adding even a gram too much flour, and would militantly pull it out for every measurement I made. 

When I came to school, however, I left the scale at home, and had to re-learn how to make bread, this time without any measurements whatsoever. I learned to feel the dough with my hands, adding water when it felt too stiff and eyeballing any inclusions I incorporated.

But since I've been trying to create new recipes of my own, I've missed the luxury of knowing exactly how much of everything I'm adding to my dough. Using my new scale, I continue to eyeball measurements, but I keep the mixing bowl on the scale and take note of the quantities of the ingredients I use.

All this being said, I made this loaf to thank my friend for the scale. I hope you like hearing about this loaf as much as I enjoyed making and sharing it.

### The Inspiration

As the academic quarter has dragged on, I've found myself missing my family and my home more than ever before. I've been making and eating food that remind me of home, like red lentil soup on a chilly evening and pancakes drowned in maple syrup on Sunday mornings.

This loaf is inspired by my older sister, who introduced me to golden milk sometime in my late middle or early high school years. Golden milk typically includes turmeric, ginger, some kind of milk, and honey. In this recipe, I also added cashews for a bit of bite and sweetness.

In this recipe, I use fresh ginger, which adds a burst of brightness without overpowering the other flavors. I'm sure dry powdered ginger would work well too.

### The Process

I've stopped making levains for most of my loaves, because I find that building, say, a rye levain for a rye loaf, really doesn't make that much of a difference in the final flavor. So I follow a general schedule of feeding my starter at night, and then using a large portion of it when I mix the dough the following morning,

As usual, I began by autolysing the flour and liquid for about an hour prior to adding my starter. For the autolyse, I added all the milk and some of the water, and then I incorporated more water later when I added the salt.

There are many sourdough bakers who harp on the ambient temperature of your proofing environment, and while I think it's important that the temperature of your proofing environment remains relatively stable throughout the process, I can't say I have the ability to maintain a constant 78 farenheit while I proof my dough. So, once I added my starter, the salt, and the remainder of the water and honey, I left the dough in my favorite place for bulk proofing: my bedroom closet.

Look, I don't want to insult anyone- if you have a proofing box, or heck, even an oven where you can viably leave your dough without worrying your roommate will preheat it to make a frozen pizza midday- I say go for it. I'm sure dough proofed at a consistent, optimal temperature yields more successful bread. But I also don't think it's worthwhile to worry so much over the temperature, even if you live in a drafty Chicago apartment that forces you to wear socks and sweatshirts at all times. 

I added the inclusion for this loaf, namely, the cashews, during the third stretch and fold. As a general rule, adding in nuts or dried fruit, etc., is easiest during the third stretch and fold. It's nice to let the dough get started a while before adding your mix-ins, but if you wait till you're done with the bulk proof, it'll be hard to work them into the dough.

I was surprised by how easy it was to shape this dough, despite the fact that it had cashews in it. Usually doughs with lots of nuts or other chunky mix-ins are a total pain to work with, but this dough handles easily.

While this recipe could easily yield two smaller loaves, I was making it for a friend, so I wanted to make a fairly substantial loaf. This was all well and good when I slid the dough into the banneton to continue to proof, but when I peaked under the towel later...

I think it's fair to say this loaf is a good sharing size. I let it proof in the refrigerator overnight, but it could also work using an ambient proofing method.

Now, onto the recipe. (Note the gram measurements! Huzzah!)

### Ingredients

* 250 g whole wheat flour
* 200 g all-purpose flour
* 50 g bread flour
* 25 g rye flour
* 1 g each ground cinnamon, grated ginger, and ground turmeric
* 150 g oat milk (or any other milk)
* 150 g water
* 200 g fed sourdough starter: white, rye, and whole wheat would all work
* 10 g honey
* 15 g salt
* 100 g cashews

### Instructions

In a large mixing bowl, add all the flours, the spices, all the milk, and 100 g of water. Reserve the other 50 g for later. Using your hands, mix the flour and liquid until it forms a shaggy dough. Cover with a tea towel and leave to autolyse for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

After the autolyse is complete, using your hands, work in the sourdough starter. Gently press the dough against the sides of the bowl as you incorporate the starter. Leave the dough to rest, covered, for another 15 minutes to an hour.

After the resting period has elapsed, work in the salt. With your fingertips, poke little holes throughout the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the salt all over the dough, and then pour in the remaining 50 g of water and the honey. Squeeze the salt, water, and honey into the dough, then gently knead to finish incorporating. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, perform one stretch and fold, stretching the dough every 90 degrees and folding it over itself. Repeat this process two more times every half hour. During the last stretch and fold, incorporate the cashews. Work them into the dough, but don't over-knead the dough. Sourdough is delicate.

Let the dough bulk proof for 4-6 hours, depending on how warm your home is. When the dough has nearly doubled, and has many large bubbles, it is ready to be shaped.

To shape the dough (I use a floored cutting board, but a clean coutertop will work too), use your hands or a dough scraper to create a tight ball with good surface tension. Be careful- if you work the dough too much, especially with inclusions, you're liable to tear the gluten (see the picture of my dough proofing above). These small tears aren't a huge deal, but if you can avoid them you should. 

Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, and then shape and place in a lined or seasoned banneton. I seasoned mine with rice floor and the dough doesn't stick. Let the dough proof covered for another 2-4 hours on the counter, or proof in the refrigerator overnight,

To bake, preheat the oven to 500 farenheit for an hour with a cookie sheet, pizza stone, or roasting tray on the middle rack. Toward the end of the hour, place another pan on a lower rack with water to create some steam. If you wish to make your dough a pumpkin shape, tie with four long pieces of twine coated in oil. 

Bake at 500 farenheit for 20 minutes, and then at 425 farenheit for another 20. Allow to cool completely, ideally 3 hours, before cutting.

### The Results

Because this was a gift loaf, I didn't take any pictures of the interior. I did, however, taste several slices, and I can attest that it is a thoroughly delicious loaf. We ate it with butter, but cooked into french toast with maple syrup would be lovely too.

A note about the pumpkin shape: tying your loaf will result in tighter crumb than usual. If your goal is an airy, light crumb, it's best not to tie the loaf, and perhaps score a pumpkin shape on top instead. If you're okay with the loaf being a little denser, then tie away! 

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I hope you have a wonderful fall and a happy Halloween!
