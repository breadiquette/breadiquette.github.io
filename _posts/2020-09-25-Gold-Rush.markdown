Having surmounted the initial difficulties of making sourdough (getting my loaves to rise, timing, baking by feel rather than by measuring), I found myself faced with another set of challenges altogether: flavored breads and inclusions.

I'm no stranger to the more "traditional" sourdough inclusions- I've made my fair share of jalepe√±o-cheddar batards and kalamata olive boules. In fact, one of my favorite loaves to date is a chocolate cherry loaf I made for a someone who is both a beloved friend and the creator of this blog! 

But after experimenting with all sorts of sourdough inclusions, I wanted to make something truely unique. The internet has enough recipes for chocolate-cherry loaves. 

As many of the best baking creations are devised, this loaf was dreamt up by the necessity to use up food in my pantry. I bought a head of ginger for cooking a few weeks ago, and found I couldn't use it as quickly as I needed. While ruminating on this conundrum over my morning coffee, I decided to try making a sourdough with ginger. While I was at it, I though, I might as well candy the ginger, as I wasn't sure a forty-odd minute sint in the oven would cut its spiciness. 

Cinnamon, of course, would complement the ginger perfectly, as would cocoa powder. And, of course, the leftover coffee I'd just brewed would amplify the chocolatey cocoa powder flavor. 

Thus, in a bout of creativity (subconciously inspired, of course, by the "flavors of fall" I see touted by my local Starbucks), Gold Rush Sourdough was born.



### The Process

The night before starting the bread, I pulled my starter out of the fridge and fed it. I've developed an incredibly precise method for its feeding, whereby I dump unspecified amounts of flour and water into its jar until it feels right.

I also candied the ginger. This didn't take much effort, either. I peeled and chopped the ginger, then boiled it until it was nearly soft, which took about 35 minutes. Then, I removed most of the cooking liquid and added what looked to be an equal mass of sugar to the ginger. I continued to cook the ginger until it was coated with sugar and nearly dried out, whisking continuously.

The next morning, I autolyzed flour and water, as per usual, this time using a rather arbitrary ratio of about 85% bread flour to 15% whole wheat flour. After about an hour of autolyse, I added a generous quantity of starter, as well as cocoa powder and a few shakes of cinnamon. A half hour later, I worked in some salt, as well as the stale coffee from the day before, which I warmed slightly and sugared liberally.

At this point, the dough smelled incredible! Around the third stretch and fold (I performed four in total), I worked in the candied ginger. I continued the bulk proof for a mere two more hours, because my radiators inexplicably kicked on and made my apartment uncomfortably stuffy.

After shaping the dough, I let it proof in the fridge for another nine hours or so. At that point, I didn't want to wait on it any longer, so I baked it- first at 500 degrees farenheit with steam for 20 minutes, then at 425 for 22 additional minutes.


### The Verdict

Generally, I rely on friends and family as tasters of my bread, because once I've gone through the labor of making a loaf, I sometimes lose the ability to decide whether I like the finished product. This time, however, I don't want to sure my bread. This loaf is incredible. Subtly sweet and warmly flavorful, with burst of bright ginger flavor, it's a winner. This loaf isn't fools' gold, folks, it's the real deal. I really pushed the hydration with this loaf, so the crumb could definitely be more open, but the lack of holes allows jam to stick nicely.

Speaking of which, this loaf is delicious enjoyed with fruit preserves, butter, or on its own. I am interested in trying to whip some maple syrup to turn the bread into a dessert, but until then, I'll still with a bare slice and a hot cup of black coffee.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I have a surprising discard recipe coming next!
