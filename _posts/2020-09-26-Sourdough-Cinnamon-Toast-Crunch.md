I am so excited about this recipe!

For a while now, I've been trying to find creative uses for my sourdough discard. I've done banana bread, crackers, granola, and so much more with it, but I've gotten tired of using the same recipes over and over again.

When doing my weekly grocery shopping recently, I thought I would briefly wander the aisles in search of something I could replicate with my sourdough starter. Most of the ideas I had weren't too feasible (YOU try adding sourdough to minestrone soup), and some had already been done before. But when I turned down the cereal aisle, it struck me that I could use my discard to replicate a childhood favorite: cinnamon toast crunch!

I'll concede- cinnamon toast crunch wasn't my favorite sweet cereal as a kid, and we hardly ever ate it in my house, but it seemed like an easier project than fruit loops or lucky charms. Plus, I figured I could make it entirely from ingredients I already had in my pantry, so I wouldn't have to purchase more ingredients just to use up my discard. The irony that the operative word of this cereal- toast- also happens to relate to sourdough isn't lost on me either!

### The Process

This recipe is incredibly straightforward. I modeled it after the recipes I've seen on the internet for sourdough crackers, following the general model of mix dough, refrigerate, roll out, bake. 

I wanted to keep oats as the basis of this cereal, so I first ground up some oats to make oat flour. In the finished product I use a combination of both oat flour and all purpose flour.

I used some homemade applesauce, which I made by cooking a peeled and chopped apple with some water and then pureeing the mixture. The applesauce binds the dough together, and it adds a subtle sweetness so you don't have to add too much sugar.

This recipe doesn't have the most formal or complicated process, and I intend it that way. Throw the ingredients together and knead until you have a dough the consistency of pie dough. Then refrigerate for about a half an hour, roll it out, and bake it.

If you don't have a rolling pin, do you really think you can call yourself a baker??

Kidding. I don't have a rolling pin, and most days I feel reasonably confident referring to myself as one. To roll out the dough, I simply flattened it into a disk, placed it between two sheets of parchment paper, and rolled it out with a glass bottle. You could also use a can of beans or a table leg if you're really desperate.

### The Results

Honestly, for how few ingredients this recipe has, I'm surprised at how similar it tastes to cinnamon toast crunch! I refrained from making the cereal super sweet, and I'm happy with the results. If you want your cereal to elicit a sugar high, however, feel free to increase the amount you use in the dough. 

The only addendum I have for this recipe is that it doesn't keep as long as boxed cereal, so it's best made only for the day it'll be consumed. The recipe is designed to serve two, or one very hungry person, but could easily be scaled up and down, especially if you're willing to make slight modifications to the amount of applesauce needed to form the dough.

Now, onto the recipe!

### Ingredients

* 1 cup oats, ground into oat flour in a blender or food processor
* 1/3 cup sourdough starter discard
* 1/3 cup all purpose flour
* 3 tbsp. applesauce
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla
* 3 tsp. cinnamon
* 1 tbsp. + 1/4 cup sugar

### Instructions

Using your hands or a stand mixer, mix together all the ingredients, reserving 2.5 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup sugar for the topping. Once the mixture forms a dough similar to pie crust, form it into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for thirty minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 farenheit. Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it as thin as possible, ideally only a few millimeters thick. In a small bowl, mix together the reserved cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkle it over both sides of the dough. Line a baking sheet with one of the sheets of parchment, and cut the dough into 1x1 cm squares. Bake on parchment for 9-12 minutes in preheated oven. Serve cereal with milk or enjoy it on its own!
