Ignoring the fact that I went to Holy Thursday Mass in a winter coat, gloves, and a hat, I am pleased to report that there are many growing things cropping up around me. Crocuses and bluebells, still weary from their long slumbers, have poked their heads above ground, gazing bleary-eyed at the world around them. Boulevards are set ablaze with daffodils and forsythia. Every morning, I awake to an ever-burgeoning chorus of birdsong, animated by the shiny new world outside my window.</p><p>If this all sounds unduly cheery for the Triduum (the culmination of the season of Lent in the Catholic tradition), let me explain. As a child, I awaited Easter with baited breath, and though I was never perfectly adherent to my Lenten resolutions, my earnest efforts to abstain from chocolate, candy, or whatever pleasure I had chosen each year came to a grand crescendo on Easter, when, arrising victoriously at 6AM, I would clammer downstairs, siblings in tow. Together, we would hunt jelly beans, chocolate eggs, and the like, scarfing down a few along the way for sustenance.</p><p>Now that I live on my own, I sometimes find it hard to rekindle the same childlike wonder I felt on holidays. Call it disallusionment if you like (I wonâ€™t), but it is hard to mark the seasons with due reverance when Iâ€™m caught up in school, work, and deadlines. To combat this lukewarmness, Iâ€™ve found a few ways to keep traditions that work for my current life. First, listening to music for each liturgical season helps me retain the solemnity of holy days in my quotidien routines. Second, I find it easier to enter into the liturgical seasons by participating in Masses and services beyond the required Sundays and holy days. Finally, I love making and enjoying the traditional foods of my Catholic heritage. This brings me to the subject of todayâ€™s post: hot cross buns.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/CrossBun3.jpg" alt="image" /></p><h3 id="a-little-background">A little background</h3><p>As many are aware, these spiced buns are the subject of a well-known song used to teach preschoolers the rudiments of recording-playing. They conjure up images of school-aged children, who, noisemakers in hand, march around the house, wheezing out the same three notes over and over again. Their melodies, however, do a great injustice to the history and delicasy of hot cross buns.</p><p>Christians have been consuming Lenten buns for millenia, particularly on Good Friday, when we recall the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Though Good Friday is a time of fasting, hot cross buns have historically been consumed for a light meal midday. The traditional spices recall those used to embalm the dead in Ancient Rome, and the crosses which adorn each bun signify Jesusâ€™ death on the cross. Interestingly, there are two different approaches to making the cross on the buns: one can either frost them after, or bake them with a paste of flour and water. I have chosen the latter option, as frosted crosses are a more recent addition to the tradition and feel substantially less Lenten.</p><p>The lore around hot cross buns is vast, but many believe that hot cross buns, as we know them today, were first disributed in the 14th century, when a charitable monk began distributing them to the poor every Good Friday. Thus, hot cross buns represent not just an internal recollection of the sanctity of Good Friday, but the call to turn outward, and to be Christ to the world around us.</p><p>This Lent, I have felt more gripped than ever by my own transgressions, by the mulitude of ways, both large and small, that I have failed to live out my faith as I should. Hot cross buns remind me of the bittersweet sacrifice of Good Friday and my renewed calling to demonstrate compassion and love to those around me.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/CrossBun0.jpeg" alt="image" /></p><h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3><p>The addition of sourdough starter to the traditional hot cross bun recipe means that the process of making these buns takes substantially longer than it does with yeast. Luckily, as with most sourdough recipes, the vast majority of this recipe is downtime. Mix the dough, let it rise overnight, form it into buns, and then let it rise again.</p><p>This is a sturdy, enriched dough, which makes it forgiving to work with. The first rise took around 15 hours in my drafty apartment; the second, about 3.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/CrossBunBake.jpeg" alt="image" /></p><p>As Iâ€™ve conceived it, this recipes makes 12 buns, although they could be made larger or smaller depending on your preference. The paste cross is piped onto the buns before baking, and, during the final minutes of baking, a maple syrup glaze is added for color and sheen. At first, it may seem that the paste cross disappears when baking, but it reappears with the additional of the maple syrup glaze.</p><p>Hot cross buns are best served hot, either straight from the oven or reheated with a lashing of butter or fruit preserves. If you donâ€™t like raisins, they can be ommitted, or replaced with another chopped dried fruit.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/CrossBun1.jpg" alt="image" /></p><p>Now, onto the recipe.</p><h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3><p>For the Dough:</p><ul><li>500 g all-purpose flour</li><li>1 cup milk</li><li>50 g maple syrup</li><li>10 g salt</li><li>1/2 cup butter (about 112 g), at room temperature</li><li>100 g fed starter</li><li>1/2 cup raisins</li><li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li><li>1 tsp cinnamon</li></ul><p>For the Cross:</p><ul><li>6 tbsp flour</li><li>1/2 cup water</li></ul><p>For the Glaze:</p><ul><li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li><li>2 tbsp water</li></ul><h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Using your fingertips, roughly incorporate the butter into the flour-salt mixture. Heat the milk and maple syrup in a small saucepan until slightly warm, remove from heat. Mix together the flour mixture, milk, maple syrup, sourdough starter, cinnamon, and vanilla. Knead slightly to form a rough ball, then knead in the raisins.</p><p>Cover the bowl with a towel and leave in a warm place to rise. The goal is for the dough to rise to twice its original size, which will likely take around 12-18 hours.</p><p>Once dough has doubled, roll into 12 balls. Oil a 9x13 baking pan, and space rolls evenlly apart in a 3x4 grid. Cover again and leave to rise for an additional 2-3 hours until puffy and well-risen.</p><p>Preheat oven to 350 for at least 30 minutes. Make the cross paste: whisk together the 6 tbsp flour and 1/2 cup water, then pipe a cross on each bun.</p><p>Make the glaze: whisk together the 2 tbsp maple syrup and 2 tbsp water. Bake buns for 25 minutes, then remove from oven and baste with glaze. Bake for an additional 3 minutes, then remove from oven.</p><p>Serve once buns have slightly cooled. Enjoy!</p><p><img src="/assets/images/CrossBun00.jpeg" alt="image" /></p></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a
