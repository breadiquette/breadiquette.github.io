<p>This! Is! Breadiquette!</p>

<hr/>

<p> Hello and welcome to Breadiquette! If you're new here, I'm Clara, and this is my blog! Breadiquette is the result of countless hours of scheming, both from myself and from a good friend Chris, a crazy smart computer scientiest to whom I probably still owe a few loaves of bread. </p>

<p> I wanted to create Breadiquette for a few reasons. First, as I moved a way from friends and family for school, I wanted an outlet through which to keep my loved ones updated on my baking endeavors. Additionally, I've found baking to be a simultaneously stimulating and relaxing respite from my studies. Finally, I believe good food should be shared, even if only through a computer screen. I encourage you to bake along with me, and let me know how it goes! </p>

<p> By way of thanks, I want to first shout out the aformentioned creator of this blog, Chris! I have immense gratitude for his invaluable support. I'd like to also thank my mom, for encouraging me to continue making sourdough even when I don't produce the results I want. I want to also mention my sister, Mary, for providing moral support, and for being my role model and best friend. This blog is a tribute to all my family and friends who have encouraged me in both my personal and my academic pursuits. Since I can't make them all bread, I can at least share with them virtually. </p>
