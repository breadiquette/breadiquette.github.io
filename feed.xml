        <title>Sourdough Hot Cross Buns</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having groped my way through another Chicago winter, I think it is finally safe to say that spring is close at hand. Ignoring the fact that I went to Holy Thursday Mass in a winter coat, gloves, and a hat, I am pleased to report that there are many growing things cropping up around me. Crocuses and bluebells, still weary from their long slumbers, have poked their heads above ground, gazing bleary-eyed at the world around them. Boulevards are set ablaze with daffodils and forsythia. Every morning, I awake to an ever-burgeoning chorus of birdsong, animated by the shiny new world outside my window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds unduly cheery for the Triduum (the culmination of the season of Lent in the Catholic tradition), let me explain. As a child, I awaited Easter with baited breath, and though I was never perfectly adherent to my Lenten resolutions, my earnest efforts to abstain from chocolate, candy, or whatever pleasure I had chosen each year came to a grand crescendo on Easter, when, arrising victoriously at 6AM, I would clammer downstairs, siblings in tow. Together, we would hunt jelly beans, chocolate eggs, and the like, scarfing down a few along the way for sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I live on my own, I sometimes find it hard to rekindle the same childlike wonder I felt on holidays. Call it disallusionment if you like (I won’t), but it is hard to mark the seasons with due reverance when I’m caught up in school, work, and deadlines. To combat this lukewarmness, I’ve found a few ways to keep traditions that work for my current life. First, listening to music for each liturgical season helps me retain the solemnity of holy days in my quotidien routines. Second, I find it easier to enter into the liturgical seasons by participating in Masses and services beyond the required Sundays and holy days. Finally, I love making and enjoying the traditional foods of my Catholic heritage. This brings me to the subject of today’s post: hot cross buns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBun3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-little-background&quot;&gt;A little background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many are aware, these spiced buns are the subject of a well-known song used to teach preschoolers the rudiments of recording-playing. They conjure up images of school-aged children, who, noisemakers in hand, march around the house, wheezing out the same three notes over and over again. Their melodies, however, do a great injustice to the history and delicasy of hot cross buns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christians have been consuming Lenten buns for millenia, particularly on Good Friday, when we recall the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Though Good Friday is a time of fasting, hot cross buns have historically been consumed for a light meal midday. The traditional spices recall those used to embalm the dead in Ancient Rome, and the crosses which adorn each bun signify Jesus’ death on the cross. Interestingly, there are two different approaches to making the cross on the buns: one can either frost them after, or bake them with a paste of flour and water. I have chosen the latter option, as frosted crosses are a more recent addition to the tradition and feel substantially less Lenten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lore around hot cross buns is vast, but many believe that hot cross buns, as we know them today, were first disributed in the 14th century, when a charitable monk began distributing them to the poor every Good Friday. Thus, hot cross buns represent not just an internal recollection of the sanctity of Good Friday, but the call to turn outward, and to be Christ to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Lent, I have felt more gripped than ever by my own transgressions, by the mulitude of ways, both large and small, that I have failed to live out my faith as I should. Hot cross buns remind me of the bittersweet sacrifice of Good Friday and my renewed calling to demonstrate compassion and love to those around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBun0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of sourdough starter to the traditional hot cross bun recipe means that the process of making these buns takes substantially longer than it does with yeast. Luckily, as with most sourdough recipes, the vast majority of this recipe is downtime. Mix the dough, let it rise overnight, form it into buns, and then let it rise again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sturdy, enriched dough, which makes it forgiving to work with. The first rise took around 15 hours in my drafty apartment; the second, about 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBunBake.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve conceived it, this recipes makes 12 buns, although they could be made larger or smaller depending on your preference. The paste cross is piped onto the buns before baking, and, during the final minutes of baking, a maple syrup glaze is added for color and sheen. At first, it may seem that the paste cross disappears when baking, but it reappears with the additional of the maple syrup glaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot cross buns are best served hot, either straight from the oven or reheated with a lashing of butter or fruit preserves. If you don’t like raisins, they can be ommitted, or replaced with another chopped dried fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBun1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Dough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;500 g all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 g maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup butter (about 112 g), at room temperature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 g fed starter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup raisins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Cross:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 tbsp flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Glaze:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Using your fingertips, roughly incorporate the butter into the flour-salt mixture. Heat the milk and maple syrup in a small saucepan until slightly warm, remove from heat. Mix together the flour mixture, milk, maple syrup, sourdough starter, cinnamon, and vanilla. Knead slightly to form a rough ball, then knead in the raisins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover the bowl with a towel and leave in a warm place to rise. The goal is for the dough to rise to twice its original size, which will likely take around 12-18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once dough has doubled, roll into 12 balls. Oil a 9x13 baking pan, and space rolls evenlly apart in a 3x4 grid. Cover again and leave to rise for an additional 2-3 hours until puffy and well-risen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 350 for at least 30 minutes. Make the cross paste: whisk together the 6 tbsp flour and 1/2 cup water, then pipe a cross on each bun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the glaze: whisk together the 2 tbsp maple syrup and 2 tbsp water. Bake buns for 25 minutes, then remove from oven and baste with glaze. Bake for an additional 3 minutes, then remove from oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve once buns have slightly cooled. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Golden Milk Pumpkin Loaf</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week, I received a kitchen scale as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first learned to make sourdough, I relied on using one to ensure I was following recipes properly and using the exact right amount of every ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m glad I had a kitchen scale at home, it became a crutch as I progressed in my sourdough baking abilities. I’d worry about adding even a gram too much flour, and would militantly pull it out for every measurement I made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came to school, however, I left the scale at home, and had to re-learn how to make bread, this time without any measurements whatsoever. I learned to feel the dough with my hands, adding water when it felt too stiff and eyeballing any inclusions I incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I’ve been trying to create new recipes of my own, I’ve missed the luxury of knowing exactly how much of everything I’m adding to my dough. Using my new scale, I continue to eyeball measurements, but I keep the mixing bowl on the scale and take note of the quantities of the ingredients I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this being said, I made this loaf to thank my friend for the scale. I hope you like hearing about this loaf as much as I enjoyed making and sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-inspiration&quot;&gt;The Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the academic quarter has dragged on, I’ve found myself missing my family and my home more than ever before. I’ve been making and eating food that remind me of home, like red lentil soup on a chilly evening and pancakes drowned in maple syrup on Sunday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This loaf is inspired by my older sister, who introduced me to golden milk sometime in my late middle or early high school years. Golden milk typically includes turmeric, ginger, some kind of milk, and honey. In this recipe, I also added cashews for a bit of bite and sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this recipe, I use fresh ginger, which adds a burst of brightness without overpowering the other flavors. I’m sure dry powdered ginger would work well too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve stopped making levains for most of my loaves, because I find that building, say, a rye levain for a rye loaf, really doesn’t make that much of a difference in the final flavor. So I follow a general schedule of feeding my starter at night, and then using a large portion of it when I mix the dough the following morning,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, I began by autolysing the flour and liquid for about an hour prior to adding my starter. For the autolyse, I added all the milk and some of the water, and then I incorporated more water later when I added the salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many sourdough bakers who harp on the ambient temperature of your proofing environment, and while I think it’s important that the temperature of your proofing environment remains relatively stable throughout the process, I can’t say I have the ability to maintain a constant 78 farenheit while I proof my dough. So, once I added my starter, the salt, and the remainder of the water and honey, I left the dough in my favorite place for bulk proofing: my bedroom closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/closet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, I don’t want to insult anyone- if you have a proofing box, or heck, even an oven where you can viably leave your dough without worrying your roommate will preheat it to make a frozen pizza midday- I say go for it. I’m sure dough proofed at a consistent, optimal temperature yields more successful bread. But I also don’t think it’s worthwhile to worry so much over the temperature, even if you live in a drafty Chicago apartment that forces you to wear socks and sweatshirts at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added the inclusion for this loaf, namely, the cashews, during the third stretch and fold. As a general rule, adding in nuts or dried fruit, etc., is easiest during the third stretch and fold. It’s nice to let the dough get started a while before adding your mix-ins, but if you wait till you’re done with the bulk proof, it’ll be hard to work them into the dough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by how easy it was to shape this dough, despite the fact that it had cashews in it. Usually doughs with lots of nuts or other chunky mix-ins are a total pain to work with, but this dough handles easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pumpkingproof.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this recipe could easily yield two smaller loaves, I was making it for a friend, so I wanted to make a fairly substantial loaf. This was all well and good when I slid the dough into the banneton to continue to proof, but when I peaked under the towel later…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pumpkingproof1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s fair to say this loaf is a good sharing size. I let it proof in the refrigerator overnight, but it could also work using an ambient proofing method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the recipe. (Note the gram measurements! Huzzah!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;250 g whole wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200 g all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 g bread flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25 g rye flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 g each ground cinnamon, grated ginger, and ground turmeric&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150 g oat milk (or any other milk)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150 g water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200 g fed sourdough starter: white, rye, and whole wheat would all work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 g honey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 g cashews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large mixing bowl, add all the flours, the spices, all the milk, and 100 g of water. Reserve the other 50 g for later. Using your hands, mix the flour and liquid until it forms a shaggy dough. Cover with a tea towel and leave to autolyse for 30 minutes to 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the autolyse is complete, using your hands, work in the sourdough starter. Gently press the dough against the sides of the bowl as you incorporate the starter. Leave the dough to rest, covered, for another 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the resting period has elapsed, work in the salt. With your fingertips, poke little holes throughout the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the salt all over the dough, and then pour in the remaining 50 g of water and the honey. Squeeze the salt, water, and honey into the dough, then gently knead to finish incorporating. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 30 minutes, perform one stretch and fold, stretching the dough every 90 degrees and folding it over itself. Repeat this process two more times every half hour. During the last stretch and fold, incorporate the cashews. Work them into the dough, but don’t over-knead the dough. Sourdough is delicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the dough bulk proof for 4-6 hours, depending on how warm your home is. When the dough has nearly doubled, and has many large bubbles, it is ready to be shaped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To shape the dough (I use a floored cutting board, but a clean coutertop will work too), use your hands or a dough scraper to create a tight ball with good surface tension. Be careful- if you work the dough too much, especially with inclusions, you’re liable to tear the gluten (see the picture of my dough proofing above). These small tears aren’t a huge deal, but if you can avoid them you should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, and then shape and place in a lined or seasoned banneton. I seasoned mine with rice floor and the dough doesn’t stick. Let the dough proof covered for another 2-4 hours on the counter, or proof in the refrigerator overnight,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bake, preheat the oven to 500 farenheit for an hour with a cookie sheet, pizza stone, or roasting tray on the middle rack. Toward the end of the hour, place another pan on a lower rack with water to create some steam. If you wish to make your dough a pumpkin shape, tie with four long pieces of twine coated in oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bake at 500 farenheit for 20 minutes, and then at 425 farenheit for another 20. Allow to cool completely, ideally 3 hours, before cutting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this was a gift loaf, I didn’t take any pictures of the interior. I did, however, taste several slices, and I can attest that it is a thoroughly delicious loaf. We ate it with butter, but cooked into french toast with maple syrup would be lovely too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note about the pumpkin shape: tying your loaf will result in tighter crumb than usual. If your goal is an airy, light crumb, it’s best not to tie the loaf, and perhaps score a pumpkin shape on top instead. If you’re okay with the loaf being a little denser, then tie away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! I hope you have a wonderful fall and a happy Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sourdough Cinnamon Toast Crunch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so excited about this recipe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I’ve been trying to find creative uses for my sourdough discard. I’ve done banana bread, crackers, granola, and so much more with it, but I’ve gotten tired of using the same recipes over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doing my weekly grocery shopping recently, I thought I would briefly wander the aisles in search of something I could replicate with my sourdough starter. Most of the ideas I had weren’t too feasible (YOU try adding sourdough to minestrone soup), and some had already been done before. But when I turned down the cereal aisle, it struck me that I could use my discard to replicate a childhood favorite: cinnamon toast crunch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll concede- cinnamon toast crunch wasn’t my favorite sweet cereal as a kid, and we hardly ever ate it in my house, but it seemed like an easier project than fruit loops or lucky charms. Plus, I figured I could make it entirely from ingredients I already had in my pantry, so I wouldn’t have to purchase more ingredients just to use up my discard. The irony that the operative word of this cereal- toast- also happens to relate to sourdough isn’t lost on me either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recipe is incredibly straightforward. I modeled it after the recipes I’ve seen on the internet for sourdough crackers, following the general model of mix dough, refrigerate, roll out, bake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to keep oats as the basis of this cereal, so I first ground up some oats to make oat flour. In the finished product I use a combination of both oat flour and all purpose flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used some homemade applesauce, which I made by cooking a peeled and chopped apple with some water and then pureeing the mixture. The applesauce binds the dough together, and it adds a subtle sweetness so you don’t have to add too much sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recipe doesn’t have the most formal or complicated process, and I intend it that way. Throw the ingredients together and knead until you have a dough the consistency of pie dough. Then refrigerate for about a half an hour, roll it out, and bake it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/dough.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a rolling pin, do you really think you can call yourself a baker??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kidding. I don’t have a rolling pin, and most days I feel reasonably confident referring to myself as one. To roll out the dough, I simply flattened it into a disk, placed it between two sheets of parchment paper, and rolled it out with a glass bottle. You could also use a can of beans or a table leg if you’re really desperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kneading.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, for how few ingredients this recipe has, I’m surprised at how similar it tastes to cinnamon toast crunch! I refrained from making the cereal super sweet, and I’m happy with the results. If you want your cereal to elicit a sugar high, however, feel free to increase the amount you use in the dough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only addendum I have for this recipe is that it doesn’t keep as long as boxed cereal, so it’s best made only for the day it’ll be consumed. The recipe is designed to serve two, or one very hungry person, but could easily be scaled up and down, especially if you’re willing to make slight modifications to the amount of applesauce needed to form the dough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the recipe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup oats, ground into oat flour in a blender or food processor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/3 cup sourdough starter discard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/3 cup all purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 tbsp. applesauce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp. salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp. vanilla&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 tsp. cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tbsp. + 1/4 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your hands or a stand mixer, mix together all the ingredients, reserving 2.5 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup sugar for the topping. Once the mixture forms a dough similar to pie crust, form it into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for thirty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 375 farenheit. Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it as thin as possible, ideally only a few millimeters thick. In a small bowl, mix together the reserved cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkle it over both sides of the dough. Line a baking sheet with one of the sheets of parchment, and cut the dough into 1x1 cm squares. Bake on parchment for 9-12 minutes in preheated oven. Serve cereal with milk or enjoy it on its own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cinnacrunch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having surmounted the initial difficulties of making sourdough (getting my loaves to rise, timing, baking by feel rather than by measuring), I found myself faced with another set of challenges altogether: flavored breads and inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no stranger to the more “traditional” sourdough inclusions- I’ve made my fair share of jalepeño-cheddar batards and kalamata olive boules. In fact, one of my favorite loaves to date is a chocolate cherry loaf I made for a someone who is both a beloved friend and the creator of this blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after experimenting with all sorts of sourdough inclusions, I wanted to make something truely unique. The internet has enough recipes for chocolate-cherry loaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of the best baking creations are devised, this loaf was dreamt up by the necessity to use up food in my pantry. I bought a head of ginger for cooking a few weeks ago, and found I couldn’t use it as quickly as I needed. While ruminating on this conundrum over my morning coffee, I decided to try making a sourdough with ginger. While I was at it, I though, I might as well candy the ginger, as I wasn’t sure a forty-odd minute sint in the oven would cut its spiciness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon, of course, would complement the ginger perfectly, as would cocoa powder. And, of course, the leftover coffee I’d just brewed would amplify the chocolatey cocoa powder flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in a bout of creativity (subconciously inspired, of course, by the “flavors of fall” I see touted by my local Starbucks), Gold Rush Sourdough was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before starting the bread, I pulled my starter out of the fridge and fed it. I’ve developed an incredibly precise method for its feeding, whereby I dump unspecified amounts of flour and water into its jar until it feels right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Starter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also candied the ginger. This didn’t take much effort, either. I peeled and chopped the ginger, then boiled it until it was nearly soft, which took about 35 minutes. Then, I removed most of the cooking liquid and added what looked to be an equal mass of sugar to the ginger. I continued to cook the ginger until it was coated with sugar and nearly dried out, whisking continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I autolyzed flour and water, as per usual, this time using a rather arbitrary ratio of about 85% bread flour to 15% whole wheat flour. After about an hour of autolyse, I added a generous quantity of starter, as well as cocoa powder and a few shakes of cinnamon. A half hour later, I worked in some salt, as well as the stale coffee from the day before, which I warmed slightly and sugared liberally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the dough smelled incredible! Around the third stretch and fold (I performed four in total), I worked in the candied ginger. I continued the bulk proof for a mere two more hours, because my radiators inexplicably kicked on and made my apartment uncomfortably stuffy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After shaping the dough, I let it proof in the fridge for another nine hours or so. At that point, I didn’t want to wait on it any longer, so I baked it- first at 500 degrees farenheit with steam for 20 minutes, then at 425 for 22 additional minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-verdict&quot;&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/GoldRush3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I rely on friends and family as tasters of my bread, because once I’ve gone through the labor of making a loaf, I sometimes lose the ability to decide whether I like the finished product. This time, however, I don’t want to sure my bread. This loaf is incredible. Subtly sweet and warmly flavorful, with burst of bright ginger flavor, it’s a winner. This loaf isn’t fools’ gold, folks, it’s the real deal. I really pushed the hydration with this loaf, so the crumb could definitely be more open, but the lack of holes allows jam to stick nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, this loaf is delicious enjoyed with fruit preserves, butter, or on its own. I am interested in trying to whip some maple syrup to turn the bread into a dessert, but until then, I’ll still with a bare slice and a hot cup of black coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! I have a surprising discard recipe coming next!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sourdough Hot Cross Buns</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having groped my way through another Chicago winter, I think it is finally safe to say that spring is close at hand. Ignoring the fact that I went to Holy Thursday Mass in a winter coat, gloves, and a hat, I am pleased to report that there are many growing things cropping up around me. Crocuses and bluebells, still weary from their long slumbers, have poked their heads above ground, gazing bleary-eyed at the world around them. Boulevards are set ablaze with daffodils and forsythia. Every morning, I awake to an ever-burgeoning chorus of birdsong, animated by the shiny new world outside my window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds unduly cheery for the Triduum (the culmination of the season of Lent in the Catholic tradition), let me explain. As a child, I awaited Easter with baited breath, and though I was never perfectly adherent to my Lenten resolutions, my earnest efforts to abstain from chocolate, candy, or whatever pleasure I had chosen each year came to a grand crescendo on Easter, when, arrising victoriously at 6AM, I would clammer downstairs, siblings in tow. Together, we would hunt jelly beans, chocolate eggs, and the like, scarfing down a few along the way for sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I live on my own, I sometimes find it hard to rekindle the same childlike wonder I felt on holidays. Call it disallusionment if you like (I won’t), but it is hard to mark the seasons with due reverance when I’m caught up in school, work, and deadlines. To combat this lukewarmness, I’ve found a few ways to keep traditions that work for my current life. First, listening to music for each liturgical season helps me retain the solemnity of holy days in my quotidien routines. Second, I find it easier to enter into the liturgical seasons by participating in Masses and services beyond the required Sundays and holy days. Finally, I love making and enjoying the traditional foods of my Catholic heritage. This brings me to the subject of today’s post: hot cross buns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBun3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-little-background&quot;&gt;A little background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many are aware, these spiced buns are the subject of a well-known song used to teach preschoolers the rudiments of recording-playing. They conjure up images of school-aged children, who, noisemakers in hand, march around the house, wheezing out the same three notes over and over again. Their melodies, however, do a great injustice to the history and delicasy of hot cross buns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christians have been consuming Lenten buns for millenia, particularly on Good Friday, when we recall the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Though Good Friday is a time of fasting, hot cross buns have historically been consumed for a light meal midday. The traditional spices recall those used to embalm the dead in Ancient Rome, and the crosses which adorn each bun signify Jesus’ death on the cross. Interestingly, there are two different approaches to making the cross on the buns: one can either frost them after, or bake them with a paste of flour and water. I have chosen the latter option, as frosted crosses are a more recent addition to the tradition and feel substantially less Lenten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lore around hot cross buns is vast, but many believe that hot cross buns, as we know them today, were first disributed in the 14th century, when a charitable monk began distributing them to the poor every Good Friday. Thus, hot cross buns represent not just an internal recollection of the sanctity of Good Friday, but the call to turn outward, and to be Christ to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Lent, I have felt more gripped than ever by my own transgressions, by the mulitude of ways, both large and small, that I have failed to live out my faith as I should. Hot cross buns remind me of the bittersweet sacrifice of Good Friday and my renewed calling to demonstrate compassion and love to those around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBun0.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of sourdough starter to the traditional hot cross bun recipe means that the process of making these buns takes substantially longer than it does with yeast. Luckily, as with most sourdough recipes, the vast majority of this recipe is downtime. Mix the dough, let it rise overnight, form it into buns, and then let it rise again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sturdy, enriched dough, which makes it forgiving to work with. The first rise took around 15 hours in my drafty apartment; the second, about 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBunBake.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve conceived it, this recipes makes 12 buns, although they could be made larger or smaller depending on your preference. The paste cross is piped onto the buns before baking, and, during the final minutes of baking, a maple syrup glaze is added for color and sheen. At first, it may seem that the paste cross disappears when baking, but it reappears with the additional of the maple syrup glaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot cross buns are best served hot, either straight from the oven or reheated with a lashing of butter or fruit preserves. If you don’t like raisins, they can be ommitted, or replaced with another chopped dried fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/CrossBun1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Dough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;500 g all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50 g maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 g salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup butter (about 112 g), at room temperature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 g fed starter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup raisins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Cross:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 tbsp flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Glaze:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Using your fingertips, roughly incorporate the butter into the flour-salt mixture. Heat the milk and maple syrup in a small saucepan until slightly warm, remove from heat. Mix together the flour mixture, milk, maple syrup, sourdough starter, cinnamon, and vanilla. Knead slightly to form a rough ball, then knead in the raisins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover the bowl with a towel and leave in a warm place to rise. The goal is for the dough to rise to twice its original size, which will likely take around 12-18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once dough has doubled, roll into 12 balls. Oil a 9x13 baking pan, and space rolls evenlly apart in a 3x4 grid. Cover again and leave to rise for an additional 2-3 hours until puffy and well-risen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 350 for at least 30 minutes. Make the cross paste: whisk together the 6 tbsp flour and 1/2 cup water, then pipe a cross on each bun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the glaze: whisk together the 2 tbsp maple syrup and 2 tbsp water. Bake buns for 25 minutes, then remove from oven and baste with glaze. Bake for an additional 3 minutes, then remove from oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve once buns have slightly cooled. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
