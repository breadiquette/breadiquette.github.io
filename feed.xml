        <title>Gold Rush Sourdough</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having surmounted the initial difficulties of making sourdough (getting my loaves to rise, timing, baking by feel rather than by measuring), I found myself faced with another set of challenges altogether: flavored breads and inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no stranger to the more “traditional” sourdough inclusions- I’ve made my fair share of jalepeño-cheddar batards and kalamata olive boules. In fact, one of my favorite loaves to date is a chocolate cherry loaf I made for a someone who is both a beloved friend and the creator of this blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after experimenting with all sorts of sourdough inclusions, I wanted to make something truely unique. The internet has enough recipes for chocolate-cherry loaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of the best baking creations are devised, this loaf was dreamt up by the necessity to use up food in my pantry. I bought a head of ginger for cooking a few weeks ago, and found I couldn’t use it as quickly as I needed. While ruminating on this conundrum over my morning coffee, I decided to try making a sourdough with ginger. While I was at it, I though, I might as well candy the ginger, as I wasn’t sure a forty-odd minute sint in the oven would cut its spiciness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon, of course, would complement the ginger perfectly, as would cocoa powder. And, of course, the leftover coffee I’d just brewed would amplify the chocolatey cocoa powder flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in a bout of creativity (subconciously inspired, of course, by the “flavors of fall” I see touted by my local Starbucks), Gold Rush Sourdough was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night before starting the bread, I pulled my starter out of the fridge and fed it. I’ve developed an incredibly precise method for its feeding, whereby I dump unspecified amounts of flour and water into its jar until it feels right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Starter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also candied the ginger. This didn’t take much effort, either. I peeled and chopped the ginger, then boiled it until it was nearly soft, which took about 35 minutes. Then, I removed most of the cooking liquid and added what looked to be an equal mass of sugar to the ginger. I continued to cook the ginger until it was coated with sugar and nearly dried out, whisking continuously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I autolyzed flour and water, as per usual, this time using a rather arbitrary ratio of about 85% bread flour to 15% whole wheat flour. After about an hour of autolyse, I added a generous quantity of starter, as well as cocoa powder and a few shakes of cinnamon. A half hour later, I worked in some salt, as well as the stale coffee from the day before, which I warmed slightly and sugared liberally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the dough smelled incredible! Around the third stretch and fold (I performed four in total), I worked in the candied ginger. I continued the bulk proof for a mere two more hours, because my radiators inexplicably kicked on and made my apartment uncomfortably stuffy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After shaping the dough, I let it proof in the fridge for another nine hours or so. At that point, I didn’t want to wait on it any longer, so I baked it- first at 500 degrees farenheit with steam for 20 minutes, then at 425 for 22 additional minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-verdict&quot;&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/GoldRush3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I rely on friends and family as tasters of my bread, because once I’ve gone through the labor of making a loaf, I sometimes lose the ability to decide whether I like the finished product. This time, however, I don’t want to sure my bread. This loaf is incredible. Subtly sweet and warmly flavorful, with burst of bright ginger flavor, it’s a winner. This loaf isn’t fools’ gold, folks, it’s the real deal. I really pushed the hydration with this loaf, so the crumb could definitely be more open, but the lack of holes allows jam to stick nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, this loaf is delicious enjoyed with fruit preserves, butter, or on its own. I am interested in trying to whip some maple syrup to turn the bread into a dessert, but until then, I’ll still with a bare slice and a hot cup of black coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! I have a surprising discard recipe coming next!&lt;/p&gt;
